Yes, the issue you’re facing is a general statistical problem: when sample size (N) is very large, even tiny effect sizes become statistically significant, making it hard to judge whether an effect is meaningful or just an artifact of the large sample.

This happens in neuroscience, social sciences, big data research, and even economics. The problem is often referred to as “practical vs. statistical significance” or “inflated significance due to large N.”

Here are classic solutions to deal with this issue:

⸻

🔹 1. Report Effect Sizes, Not Just p-values

✅ Why?
	•	A p-value tells you whether an effect exists but doesn’t tell you how big it is.
	•	In large samples, even trivial effects can get p < 0.001.

✅ Solution:
Always report effect size measures like:
	•	Cohen’s d (for mean differences)
	•	Pearson’s r (for correlations)
	•	Standardized beta coefficients (β) (for regressions)

🔹 Example:
Instead of just:

	p < 0.0001

Report:

	β = 0.05, p < 0.0001, Cohen’s d = 0.10 (small effect)

👉 If effect sizes are tiny, reconsider the practical importance of your finding.

⸻

🔹 2. Use Confidence Intervals Instead of p-values

✅ Why?
	•	Confidence intervals (CIs) show the range of plausible values for an effect.
	•	If the CI is very narrow around 0, the effect may be statistically significant but practically meaningless.

✅ Solution:
	•	Report 95% CIs alongside p-values.
	•	If CI is close to 0, the effect may not be meaningful.

🔹 Example:
Instead of just:

	β = 0.03, p < 0.0001

Report:

	β = 0.03, 95% CI = [0.01, 0.05], p < 0.0001

👉 If CI = [0.01, 0.05], even though p < 0.0001, the effect is tiny and likely unimportant.

⸻

🔹 3. Perform a Meaningful Power Analysis

✅ Why?
	•	Many large-sample studies are overpowered, meaning they detect even negligible effects.
	•	Power analysis ensures that you’re detecting effects that actually matter.

✅ Solution:
	•	Compute the smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) before running the study.
	•	Adjust sample size so that only effects above a meaningful threshold are detectable.

🔹 Example:
	•	If a study detects β = 0.01 with p < 0.0001, ask:
Would an effect of 0.01 even matter in real life?
	•	If not, consider setting a minimum effect threshold before starting the analysis.

⸻

🔹 4. Apply Regularization (Shrink Small Effects to Zero)

✅ Why?
	•	Regularization techniques shrink small effects toward zero, reducing false positives.
	•	This is useful in high-dimensional models (e.g., neuroscience, machine learning).

✅ Solution:
	•	Use Lasso regression (L1-regularization) to penalize weak predictors.
	•	Use Bayesian shrinkage priors (e.g., Horseshoe priors) to remove small effects.

🔹 Example:
Instead of:

import statsmodels.api as sm
result = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()
print(result.summary())

Use:

from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
model = Lasso(alpha=0.01).fit(X, y)

👉 This forces small, spurious effects to zero.

⸻

🔹 5. Use Bootstrapping to Estimate Effect Stability

✅ Why?
	•	Bootstrapping provides robust estimates by resampling data.
	•	It helps assess whether an effect is reliable or just an artifact.

✅ Solution:
	•	Instead of relying on single p-values, run bootstrap simulations (e.g., 1000 times) and check the distribution of effect sizes.

🔹 Example (Python Bootstrap Regression):

import numpy as np
from sklearn.utils import resample

bootstrapped_betas = []
for _ in range(1000):
    X_resampled, y_resampled = resample(X, y, random_state=_)
    beta = np.linalg.lstsq(X_resampled, y_resampled, rcond=None)[0]
    bootstrapped_betas.append(beta)

print("95% Bootstrap CI:", np.percentile(bootstrapped_betas, [2.5, 97.5]))

👉 If bootstrap CIs vary wildly, the effect is unstable.

⸻

🔹 6. Use Dimensionality Reduction in Large-Scale Data

✅ Why?
	•	If your data has high redundancy, many “significant” findings may be correlated artifacts.
	•	Dimensionality reduction removes unnecessary variables, making significance more meaningful.

✅ Solution:
	•	Apply PCA (Principal Component Analysis) before running statistical tests.
	•	Cluster correlated predictors to avoid inflated false positives.

🔹 Example (Python PCA on Neural Data):

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=10).fit(X)  # Reduce to 10 independent components
X_reduced = pca.transform(X)

👉 This ensures that only truly independent features contribute to significance.

⸻

🔹 7. Use Bayesian Inference Instead of Frequentist Testing

✅ Why?
	•	Frequentist p-values can be misleading in large samples.
	•	Bayesian models provide probabilistic interpretations of effect strength.

✅ Solution:
	•	Instead of p-values, use Bayes Factors (BF) to quantify evidence.
	•	If BF < 3, the evidence is weak even if p < 0.0001.

🔹 Example (Using PyMC for Bayesian Regression):

import pymc3 as pm

with pm.Model():
    beta = pm.Normal("beta", mu=0, sigma=1)
    y_pred = pm.Normal("y_pred", mu=beta * X, sigma=1, observed=y)
    trace = pm.sample(2000)
    
pm.summary(trace)

👉 Bayesian inference allows direct probability statements, like:

	There is a 95% chance that the true β lies between 0.01 and 0.05.

🚀 Final Recommendation

If you’re analyzing neuroscience/social science RSA results, the best fix is:
1️⃣ Report effect sizes (β, r, Cohen’s d) alongside p-values.
2️⃣ Use bootstrapping or confidence intervals (95% CI) instead of p-values.
3️⃣ Apply regularization (Lasso or Bayesian shrinkage) if many variables are tested.
4️⃣ Use dimensionality reduction (PCA) if RDMs are redundant.
5️⃣ Use Bayesian methods (instead of p-values) for a more meaningful interpretation.
